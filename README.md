## Overview of the analysis

PH is a large company posting severy employees and has been around for a long time .As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate PH is looking towards the future in two ways.
1.Its offering retirement package who meet certain criteria.
2.Its starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in thE near future .
The number of upcoming retirements means a thousands of job openings.I have helped bobby HR analyst whose task is to perform employee research answer the questions like who will be retiring in next few years and how many positions will PH need to fill.This analysis will help future proof PH by generating a list of all employees eligibile for retirement package.
I have helped HR anlyst to build an employee data base with SQL by applying data modelling ,engineerign and analysis skills.Have used Postges as the DB to perform the task.
Aditionally have helped  determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

  - This data helps the PH future-proof the company by plannign ahead and start with the recruting process as in when the employees retire or take voluntary retirement.
  - The Second analysis was to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on the title and their experience 
  - This data would give a better idea to plan on the mentoriship program when new joiners are hired.
  - retirement_titles, unique_titles, retiring_titles, and mentorship_eligibilty table would provide all the information thats needed for the management to make a plan to future proof the company
